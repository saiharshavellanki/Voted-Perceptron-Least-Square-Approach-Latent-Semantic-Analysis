For q1:
input is num_of_epochs and k (k-fold)
For q2:
To run use python lsa.py arg
arg=1 to run on dataset1
arg=2 to run on dataset2
similarly for lda
For q3:
To run multiclass perceptron use python 201501157_q2_a.py trainpath testpath 
Number of epochs is input for it
To run cosine similarity 201501157_q2_a.py trainpath testpath
